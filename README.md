  Software Engineer I – Data Analytics @ <b>EyeROV Technologies Pvt. Ltd.</b> • Exploring the intersection of <b>ML / CV</b> and <b>Full-Stack</b> engineering.
</p>

## 🚀 Current Focus
- **Learning Full-Stack web development** using the practical roadmaps and checkpoints from roadmap.sh (frontend → backend → deployment). :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- **Following _100 Days of ML Code_** (daily hands-on ML tasks, notebooks, and projects) to sharpen ML fundamentals and build reproducible projects. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

## 🧭 Learning Roadmaps (what I'm following)
I’m combining both paths — building full apps end-to-end while applying ML where it fits.

**Full-Stack (roadmap highlights)** — core areas I'm covering:  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Tailwind, accessibility & testing.  
- **Backend:** Node.js / Express (or alternative), RESTful APIs, auth (JWT), databases (Postgres / MongoDB).  
- **DevOps / Deployment:** Docker, CI/CD (GitHub Actions), basic AWS (S3/EC2), monitoring and infra as code. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

**100 Days of ML (structure)** — daily/practical items I follow:  
- Data preprocessing, classical ML (linear/logistic/regression, trees), feature engineering, model evaluation.  
- Deep learning basics, CNNs, transfer learning, and small reproducible projects / notebooks. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

## 🎯 Goals
- Ship open-source projects that combine CV/ML with full-stack apps.  
- Finish 100 Days of ML (notebooks + 3 deployable ML demos).  
- Become comfortable architecting and deploying production ML services.
